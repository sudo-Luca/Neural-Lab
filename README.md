## ✨ What is Neural Lab?

Neural Lab is an interactive deep learning simulator designed to make neural networks understandable.

No framework.  
No installation.  
No server.

Just open **one HTML file** and start experimenting.

Every computation happens directly in your browser:

- Forward propagation
- Backpropagation
- Gradient calculation
- Weight updates
- Optimiser behaviour
- Decision boundaries
- Network visualisation

Built with **pure HTML + CSS + Vanilla JavaScript**.

Watch a neural network learn in real time:
- neurons activating
- weights changing
- loss decreasing
- decision boundaries evolving

Neural Lab is not just a trainer.

It is an exploration environment.

![Tools panel](screenshots/tools.png)


Included tools:

### Gradient Analysis

Find:

- Vanishing gradients
- Exploding gradients
- Layer imbalance


### Weight Heatmap

See how your network parameters evolve.

![Heatmap](screenshots/heatmap.png)


### Decision Boundary

Visualise what your classifier has learned.

![Decision boundary](screenshots/boundary.png)


### Optimiser Race

Run several optimisers against each other and watch who learns faster.

# 🎨 Designed for Learning

Neural Lab includes educational features:

- Formula library
- Step-by-step explanations
- Mathematical notation rendering
- Detailed training logs
- Interactive inspection


![Formula library](screenshots/formulas.png)


Instead of only seeing:

```
Loss = 0.034
```

you can explore:

```
How was the prediction computed?
Why did the gradient change?
Which weights were updated?
```

# ⚡ Quick Start

## Option 1 — Open directly

Download the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sudo-Luca/Neural-Lab.git
```

Open:

```
Neural-Lab/Neural-Lab-v12.html
```

That's it.

No installation.
No build step.

---

## Option 2 — Run locally

Any modern browser works:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Safari


---

# 🧩 Example Experiments

## XOR Problem

A classic neural network challenge.

```
0 XOR 0 → 0
0 XOR 1 → 1
1 XOR 0 → 1
1 XOR 1 → 0
```

Try:

```
Input: 2
Hidden: 4
Output: 1
Activation: ReLU
Optimizer: Adam
```

---

## Spiral Classification

A harder nonlinear problem.


---

## Regression

Approximate mathematical functions:

```
y = sin(x)
```

Watch the network learn a curve.

# 🏗️ Architecture

Neural Lab is intentionally simple:

```
Single HTML file

├── HTML
│   └── Interface
│
├── CSS
│   └── Dark UI system
│
└── JavaScript
    ├── Neural network engine
    ├── Training algorithms
    ├── Canvas renderer
    └── Interactive tools
```

No frameworks.

No hidden magic.

Everything is visible.
